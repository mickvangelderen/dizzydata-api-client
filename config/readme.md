To run the test suite, put your dizzydata username and password in a config file as illustrated below.

`config/development-config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    dizzydata: {
        URL: 'https://api.dizzydata.com/',
        USERNAME: '<YOUR USERNAME>',
        PASSWORD: '<YOUR PASSWORD>'
    }
};
```
